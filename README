Introduction for this project:

This project build a topic specific crawler looks for documents or data matching for a particular category — specified as an XPath expression. The system includs following components:

1. A servlet-based Web application that allows users to create topic-specific “channels” defined by a set of XPath expression and displays documents that match a channel. 

2. A crawler that traverses the Web, looking for HTML and XML documents that match one of the XPath expression. 

3. An XPath evaluation engine that determines if an HTML or XML document that match one of the XPath expressions 

4. A persistent data store, using Oracle Berkeley DB,to hold retrieved HTML/XML documents and channel definitions

instructions for building and running your solution?

To Run stormLite under folder  edu.upenn.cis.stormlite.RunCrawlerStorm specify :
http://crawltest.cis.upenn.edu ./database 1000 50 

- Crawler Web Interface.
    - Path: /servlet/crawler
    - Be able to 
    	- start the crawler
    	- set crawler parameters
	- display results after the crawler's execution
		- number of HTML pages scanned for links
		- list of HTML pages scanned for links, linked to LookupServlet
		- number of XML documents retrieved
		- list of XML pages scanned for links, linked to LookupServlet
		- amount of data downloaded
		- number and list of servers visited	
  - I claimed "database" as DB path in both web.xml and "ant crawl" target in build.xml.
  - I use Jetty to test my servlets. Here are their functions, names, and paths to call using Jetty.
    e.g. send a GET request to XPathServlet using http://localhost:8080/servlet/xpath. 
  	- main page      XPathServlet      /servlet/xpath
  	- log in page    LoginServlet      /servlet/login
  	- sign up page   SignupServlet     /servlet/signup
  	- logout page    LogoutServlet     /servlet/logout
  	- lookup page    LookupServlet     /servlet/lookup?url=xxxxxx
  	- POST-TO page   RegisterServlet   /servlet/register.jsp
  - I use JSoup to traverse links in HTML documents.
  	- Include jsoup-1.9.2.jar in lib
  - ant crawl: launch main method in XPathCrawler, crawl the Web starting with the sandbox.
  	- I set the parameters of 'crawl' target in build.xml as following:
	<arg value="http://crawltest.cis.upenn.edu"/>
	<arg value="database"/>
	<arg value="100"/>
  - ant servlet: copy servlet to /jetty/webapps and start Jetty from /jetty.
